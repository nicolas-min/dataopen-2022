# 1 Executive Summary

## 1.1 Background 

Reducing early (<30 days) hospital readmissions is of paramount policy priority aimed at improving healthcare quality. Hence, numerous studies have explored this topic (including Leppin et al. (2015) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4249925/)

From our manipulated dataset (manipulation steps detailed below), almost ten percent (8.97%) of patients diagnosed with diabetes come back to the hospital for an inpatient visit. Considering that this number does not consider patients who 1.dies/gets relocated to hospice (hence cannot be readmitted) or 2. re-visits hospital for outpatient visit, this is only the lower bound of the problem in our healthcare system.

Our research question

# 2 Technical Exposition

## 2.1 Data Identification


In order to determine the usefulness, reliability, and relevance of the data, each data element was analyzed to determine if it should be included as transformations to impact re admittance. The data elements themselves are organized in 3 categories: patient history, treatment, and patient demographic.

### Patient Identification

#### encounter_id
Used as the index for hospital visits

#### patient_nbr
Used as the index for patients

#### weight / medical_specialty
Not used as the data was too sparse.

#### payer_code //check to make sure
Not used due to irrelevance.


### Treatment

#### admission_type_id / admission_source_id
The type of admission and source of admission can indicate the intensity or stage until diabetes diagnosis, impacting the effectiveness of possible future medications.

#### discharge_disposition_id
The type of discharge can indicate the condition of patient after care, impacting the possibility of future re-admittance.

#### time_in_hospital
May indicate the condition of the patient during treatment and the incidence of re admittance.

#### medical_specialty //check again
Not used as treatment is assumed to be standardized.

#### num_lab_procedures / num_procedures
How many times a patient is tested may impact the quality of the diagnosis and treatment.

#### num_medications
The number of medications may indicate the severity of diabetes.

#### diag_1
This data was grouped into 9 codes as previously stated in 2.1. Impacts the medication given.

#### diag_2 / diag_3
Are not the primary diagnoses, therefore removed to simplify the data.

#### number_diagnoses
May indicate the quality of the diagnosis and treatment offered.

#### metformin / repaglinide / nateglinide / chloropropamide / glimepiride / acetohexamide / glipizide / glyburide / tolbutamide / pioglitazone / rosiglitazone / acarbose / miglitol / troglitazone / tolazamide / examide / citoglipton / insulin / glyburide-metformin / glipizide-metformin / glimepiride-pioglitazone / metformin-rosiglitazone / metformin-ploglitazone / diabetesMed

The type of medication prescribed and combination may impact diabetes treatment processes.

#### change
Change in diabetic medication may indicate the changing severity of diabetes on the patient.


### Patient History and Health

#### gender
Genetic differences may impact re-admittance, as well as social or systematic biases that may change how different genders are treated.

#### age
Different ages may change the outcome of diabetes, like older individuals being more prone to the impacts of diabetes as well as having other health conditions.

#### number_outpatient / number-emergency / number_inpatient
The number of preceding encounters may indicate other health conditions that may impact the severity of diabetes.

#### max_glu_serum / A1Cresult
The main two indicators of diabetes, with varying ranges indicating varying diabetes impacts.

### Target Variable

#### readmitted
Indicates the range of days until a patient was readmitted.


## 2.2 Data Manipulation

Agreeing with the justifications made by Strack et al.(2014), we performed the following data manipulation prior to model fitting (see Strack et al.(2014) for the justifications). We checked that our summary statistics match Table2 of Strack et al.

1. Imputed '?' in medical specialty with "missing"
2. Kept only the first encounter for each patient.
3. Removed all encounters that resulted in either discharge to a hospice or patient death (because for these patients, no readmission is not a positive outcome)
4. Grouped icd9 codes by: circulatory, respiratory, digestive, diabetes, injury, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, neoplasms, and other.
5. Focused on "recent readmittance" by categorizing the "readmitted" element as either <30  days or "other"


## 2.3 Modeling

Assumptions (both implicit and explicit) made in the Strack et al.(2014) were made in our analysis as well. Below are these assumptions. 

1. There is no seasonality in the data. That is, we treat our data as cross-sectional.
2. Readmissions (especially early re-admissions) are regarded as a negative outcome. Put it differently, non-readmissions are regarded as a positive outcome. That is, we ignore patients' lack of trust in the healthcare system which could prevent them visiting hospitals (e.g., Black patients' disbelief in the healthcare systemn has been documented in literatures such as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758504/).

Note that just like in Strack et al. (2014), we focus on "early" re-admissions. This is because if we focus on readmitted/non-readmitted instead, we would inevitably have to make an unreasonable assumption that having 'NO' for readmitted means that the patient was never readmitted (we don't know this because our data ends at 2008).
